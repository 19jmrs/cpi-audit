# SAP CI Audit Integrations

## Overview

From our day to day operations we sometimes find the need to know the versions history, current deployment and description of the versions of the Iflow's presents in our tenant.
The web ui allows us to do this, but doing it for multiple tenants can be a painfull process, therefore and inspired by other projects such as: cpi-navigator, cpilint and other, I decided to play a little bit with the go language and with the SAP public API's to create a tool that allows us to do this in a more automated way.
